# Barcelona 


A whole year later and I am finally writing my post about Barcelona... This has been a long time coming. Barcelona is the perfect city break if you are looking to go somewhere warm. We spent 4 days at the end of September exploring Barcelona on foot, the weather was perfect,the food was delecious and the architechture is phenominal the buildings are seeped in history and colour. 

The Vanvan market fell on the weekend we were visiting (which I was so excited for), I think it's a must for all foodies. It is a brightly coloured food truck market awash with varying cuisines to suit everyone, it is a feats for they eyes as well as the bellies. It moves around to various locations across the city, this one was held in the Parc de la Ciutadella which also meant we could hit two birds with one stone and explore the park, including a go in the row boats.
