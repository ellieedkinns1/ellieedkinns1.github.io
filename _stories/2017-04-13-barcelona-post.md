I had never been to Spain prior to our trip to Barcelona, my families go to destination as a child was always france so I was excited for my first adventure in Spain to begin in Barcelona, the city famous for it's modernist landmarks designed by Antoni Gaudi.

We spent 4 days at the end of September exploring Barcelona on foot, the weather was perfect,the food was delecious and the architechture was an array of buildings seeped in history and colour.

My top tips for Barcelona:
-The vanvan market is a must for all foodies. It is a brightly coloured food truck market awash with varying cuisines to suit everyone, it is a feats for they eyes as well as the bellies.
-September is a good time of year to go, itâ€™s not to hot and the sun is still out. 
-Allow plenty of time to visit the La Sagrada Familia and book online prior to your trip
