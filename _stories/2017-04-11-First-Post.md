# A week in Cornwall




Home, home for me is Cornwall, it ’s where my family are (pets included) it’s my peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of London. A place where a walk on the cliffs or through a field is a daily occurrence, eating eggs laid by a chicken that lives up the lane is completely normal and bumping into someone you know in the supermarket is not an omg you live around here moment. 

At the end of Feb I took my annual week long trip home to celebrate my older brother and parents birthdays. I always visit at this time of year and have done for the last 4 years.  I try to visit Cornwall every 3 months or so If I can, I love Cornwall, I always have and I always will. It is the most picturesque place even on the gloomiest of winter days full of lots of my favourite people. Half of me wishes I lived closer and the other half is glad that it’s so far away and I’m fortunate enough to have such a wonderful place to retreat to, thats worlds apart from London. 

This is my first post so I am struggling with what to say, writing is not my forte. So here are some images from my trip home. I hope you enjoy.
