# My First Post!

My first blog post here it goes! 

I have actualy done it, i've built a website from scratch. At the begining of 2016 I said I was going to build my own website.. obviously this would mean learning how to code, understanding all the lingo and somehow getting my head around the massive mind blower that is the world wide web which is something I didn't take into account when I first set this as my 2016 goal, unfortunatly for me I have this problem where I like to make my life harder by going the long route.

At first I didn't take into account how long it would take me to actually learn all of this whilst working full time, going to exercise classes and trying not to spend every spare moment I have glued to my computer. I put it on the back burner for a while as I couldn't find the time to work on it. Before I knew it I was making 2017 goals and here it is, April 2017 one goal down.
